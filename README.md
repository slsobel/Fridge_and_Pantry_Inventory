# Fridge_and_Pantry_Inventory
My first side project, modeled after the classic Vending Machine OOP &amp; File I/O exercise.

With lots of us being at home for COVID, using up ingredients in our pantries and fridges is necessary to keeping costs down and shopping trips minimal.
I am creating an inventory of my fridge, freezer, and pantry so that I can keep track of how many items I have, their expiration dates, and where they should be on the shelves. 

I'm going to try using the FIFO approach. Eventually, I'd like to use this repository/inventory to work with a recipe database. That way, I can run the available ingredients I have and populate a list of recipes I can make with them at any given time. This will be useful for any home cook!
